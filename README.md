# Next.js App Router Course - Final

This is the final template for the Next.js App Router Course. It contains the final code for the dashboard application.

For more information, see the [course curriculum](https://nextjs.org/learn) on the Next.js Website.

## Folder structure

- /app: Contains all the routes, components, and logic for your application, this is where you'll be mostly working from.
- /app/lib: Contains functions used in your application, such as reuseable utility functions and data fetching functions.
- /app/ui: Contains all the UI components for your application, such as cards, tables, and forms. To save time, we've pre-styled these components for you.
- /public: Contains all the static assets for your application, such as images.
- /scripts/: Contains a file that you'll use to populate your database in a later chapter.
- Config Files: You'll also notice config files such as next.config.js at the root of your application. Most of these files are created and pre-configured when you start a new project using create-next-app. You will not need to modify them in this course.

## Getting Started with the Template

To get started with the template, you'll need to install the dependencies by running:

    npm install
and run the development server.

    npm run dev

To access the application, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Then, you'll need to start database by running:
    npm run seed
This will populate your database with the data you'll need.
